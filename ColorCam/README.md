# ColorCam: Real-Time Color-Blindness Correction App

## Overview
ColorCam is a computer vision project designed to help people with color vision deficiencies (color blindness) see colors more accurately. The project applies real-time color correction filters to images and live camera feeds to enhance distinguishability of colors for users with Protanopia, Deuteranopia, and Tritanopia.
